# My First Post

What's to say? I finally got hooked up with my grid beta account. Only took about a year to happen. Clunky at the moment, but it is, after all, my first 30 minutes on the site...so much for a website in 3 minutes. 

As I reflect on what I'd like to say in my first post, I really cannot think what more to say. It's late, I really want to be more excited about finally gaining access to this thing, but, I've got bigger things to stress out about, especially right before the holidays. I'll continue to tinker as the time allows, and I hope that I find the time fruitful and encouraging. Here's to hoping it works!
